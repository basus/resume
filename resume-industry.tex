    \section{Projects}
    {\bf Metaphor: A declarative approach to computational art}\\
    Research project to develop software for visual artists to leverage
    computational tools. Developed a declarative programming language as an
    interface to graphical libraries written in Python.

    {\bf Parley: A concurrent object-oriented programming language}\\
    Senior honors thesis project to develop a programming language for more
    efficient use of multi-core CPUs. Implements the Actor model of computation
    in the context of a Smalltalk-like object-oriented language.

    Implementation of thread-based concurrent Actors in Ruby using a
    prototype-based programming style. Makes extensive use of Ruby's
    metaprogramming abilities. Proof-of-concept precursor to Parley.

    {\bf Litepipe: A multithreaded server library} \\
    A simple library for writing TCP servers using a thread-per-client
    model. Includes an echo server and working on a basic HTTP server. Written
    in C using the pthreads threading library.

    {\bf WimpFi: Wireless Peer-to-peer Communications Network}\\
    A wireless short-range peer-to-peer network. Allows personals computer to
    communicate via RF-transceivers implemented on FPGAs. Implements a reduced
