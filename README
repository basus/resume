This is a repo to hold my resume and curriculum vitae. I use a LaTeX template to
generate PDFs for both. For resumes I have one for industry and one for academia
and research. That's the only way to stay within one page and still fit in
everything relevant. The CV is a more complete document. It uses a different
format with more space because I'm not trying to fit within a space constraint.

The templates are based on stuff I've found on the web. Credits are in the LaTeX
files.

I'll add an explanation of the various choices I've made and an HTML version
soon.
